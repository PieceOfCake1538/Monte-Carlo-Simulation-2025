# Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)

This repository contains a full implementation of a Monte Carlo stock-price simulator based on the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.
It includes a research-style PDF report, a well-structured Jupyter Notebook, and visualizations of simulated price paths and ending-price distributions.

This project is ideal for students, quants, researchers, and anyone exploring stochastic modeling, risk simulation, or quantitative finance fundamentals.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to model future stock-price uncertainty using Monte Carlo methods.
The simulation leverages:
Historical stock data
Estimated drift (μ) and volatility (σ)
The GBM stochastic differential equation
1000 simulated paths over a 1-year horizon
Statistical analysis and visual graphics

Both the PDF report and Jupyter Notebook implement all mathematical steps and methodologies used in modern quantitative finance.
