# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-2025
This repository implements a Monte Carlo stock-price simulator using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model. It includes a research-style PDF report and a clean Jupyter Notebook. Ideal for students, quants, and researchers exploring stochastic modeling, risk simulation, and quantitative finance.
